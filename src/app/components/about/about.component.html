  <p class="p-mb-3">
    This blog is a capstone project for our bachelor's degree in Computer
    Science and Software Development and Security. The course is a senior-level
    program that allows us to work in teams to design, develop, test, implement,
    and document a semester-long project in a current computer science
    application area. Our blog is an example of a reusable and scalable
    application developed using the most current technologies and approaches.
